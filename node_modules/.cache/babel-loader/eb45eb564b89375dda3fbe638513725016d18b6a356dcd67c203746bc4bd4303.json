I also played with the idea of other persons instead of the Social Suzy persona including professors and other students. But ultimately, I decided that ultimately that the Social Suzy persona best reflected my observations and interviews. I also took inspiration from the examples in class and other online personas to decide on the format of the personas and am happy with the look of the final personas. I also created my first storyboard for my Late Larry persona, I began, stopped and restarted many times for this portion of the project but ended up hand drawing the scenario.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"ProjectSection\">\n                <h1>Conclusions & Takeaways</h1>\n                <p> This project gave me better insight not only into who the users of Spin Scooters are, but also helped me better understand the principles behind the  user experience of any product. From this project I took a new way of thinking about product and interface design and was more aware of them in my everyday life.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div >\n    );\n}\n\n\nexport default Personas;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAO,gBAAgB;AACvB,OAAO,eAAe;AAAC;AAEvB,SAASA,QAAQ,GAAG;EAChB,oBACI;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;IAAA,wBACpB;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAA,wBAC3B;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAA0B,eAC1B;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAkd,eACld;QAAK,GAAG,EAAC,0BAA0B;QAAC,KAAK,EAAE;MAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAO;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACxD,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAA,wBAC3B;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAA8B,eAC9B;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACI,eACJ;QAAK,GAAG,EAAC;MAAmC;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAO;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACjD,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;MAAA,wBACrB;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAiB,eACjB;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,mBAAmB;QAAA,wBAC1B;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,SAAS;UAAA,wBAChB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAoB,eACpB;YAAG,KAAK,EAAE;cAAE,QAAQ,EAAE;YAAQ,CAAE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAEmE,eACnG;YAAK,GAAG,EAAC,wCAAwC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,2CAA2C;YAAC,KAAK,EAAE;UAAM;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAChH,eACN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,SAAS;UAAA,wBAChB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAoB,eACpB;YAAG,KAAK,EAAE;cAAE,QAAQ,EAAE;YAAQ,CAAE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAIgD,eAChF;YAAK,GAAG,EAAC,wCAAwC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,2CAA2C;YAAC,KAAK,EAAE;UAAM;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAChH;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACJ;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACJ,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;MAAA,wBACxB;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAmB,eACnB;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,mBAAmB;QAAA,wBAC1B;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;UAAA,wBACrB;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,kCAAkC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAuB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG,eAChG;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACe;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACb,eACN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;UAAA,wBACrB;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,iCAAiC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAuB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG,eAC/F;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAA0F;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACxF,eAEN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;UAAA,wBACrB;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,iCAAiC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAuB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG,eAC/F;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACgB;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACd,eAEN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;UAAA,wBACrB;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,iCAAiC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAuB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG,eAC/F;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACc;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACZ,eAEN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;UAAA,wBACrB;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,iCAAiC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAuB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG,eAC/F;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAyE;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACvE,eAEN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;UAAA,wBACrB;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,iCAAiC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAuB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG,eAC/F;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACI;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF,eAEN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;UAAA,wBACrB;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,iCAAiC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAuB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG,eAC/F;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACI;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF,eACN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;UAAA,wBACrB;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC,iCAAiC;YAAC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAuB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAG,eAC/F;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAyD;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACvD;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACJ;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACJ,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAA,wBAC3B;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAsC,eACtC;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAqpB;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACnpB,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAA,wBAC3B;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAgC,eAChC;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAA+T;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAC7T;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACH;AAEf;AAAC,KA5FQA,QAAQ;AA+FjB,eAAeA,QAAQ;AAAC;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
