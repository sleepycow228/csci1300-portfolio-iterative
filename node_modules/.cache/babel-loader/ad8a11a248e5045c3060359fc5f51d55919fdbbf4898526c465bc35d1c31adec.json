This was something I now will make sure to consider moving forward.</p>\n\n            </div>\n        </div >\n\n    )\n}\n\nexport default IterativeDesign"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAO,uBAAuB,CAC9B,MAAO,eAAe,CAAC,wFAEvB,QAASA,gBAAe,EAAG,CACvB,mBACI,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,wBACpB,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,wBAC3B,sCAAuB,cACvB,ihBAQI,GACF,cACN,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,uBAC3B,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,8CAA8C,2CAAkC,EACtF,cACN,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,wBAC3B,wCAAyB,cACzB,gMAEI,GACF,cACN,4IAA4H,cAC5H,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,uBAC3B,oCACI,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,0BAA0B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,kBAAkB,EAAG,cACjF,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,0BAA0B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,kBAAkB,EAAG,cACjF,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,6BAA6B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAqB,EAAG,GACrF,EACJ,cACN,2HAA2G,cAC3G,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,uBAC3B,oCACI,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,iCAAiC,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,yBAAyB,EAAG,cAC/F,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,2BAA2B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,mBAAmB,EAAG,cACnF,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,0BAA0B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,kBAAkB,EAAG,cACjF,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,0BAA0B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,kBAAkB,EAAG,GAC/E,EACJ,cACN,yGAAyF,cACzF,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,gBAAgB,uBACvB,oCACI,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,oCAAoC,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAqB,EAAG,cAC9F,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,6BAA6B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAqB,EAAG,cACvF,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,oBAAoB,EAAG,GACnF,EACJ,cACN,0JAA0I,cAC1I,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,gBAAgB,uBACvB,oCACI,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,0BAA0B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,kBAAkB,EAAG,cACjF,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,mCAAmC,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,uBAAuB,EAAG,cAC/F,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,6BAA6B,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAqB,EAAG,GACrF,EACJ,cACN,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,wBAC3B,2CAEK,cACL,kNAII,GACF,cACN,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,uBAC3B,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,wBAC3B,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,cAAc,wBAAC,gCAAgB,0BAAK,KAAK,CAAC,iBAAiB,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,uCAAuC,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,kBAAkB,EAAG,GAAM,cACtJ,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,cAAc,wBAAC,iCAAiB,0BAAK,KAAK,CAAC,iBAAiB,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,wCAAwC,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,wBAAwB,EAAG,GAAM,cAC9J,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,cAAc,wBAAC,4BAAY,0BAAK,KAAK,CAAC,iBAAiB,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,mCAAmC,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,mBAAmB,EAAG,GAAM,cAC/I,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,cAAc,wBAAC,8CAA8B,0BAAK,KAAK,CAAC,iBAAiB,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,qDAAqD,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,4BAA4B,EAAG,GAAM,cAC5L,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,cAAc,wBAAC,gCAAgB,0BAAK,KAAK,CAAC,iBAAiB,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,4CAA4C,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,uBAAuB,EAAG,GAAM,cAChK,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,cAAc,wBAAC,mCAAmB,0BAAK,KAAK,CAAC,iBAAiB,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,0CAA0C,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAqB,EAAG,GAAM,cAC/J,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,cAAc,wBAAC,uCAAuB,0BAAK,KAAK,CAAC,iBAAiB,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,8CAA8C,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,8BAA8B,EAAG,GAAM,GAC9K,EACJ,cACN,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,wBAC3B,uCAEK,cACL,gMAEI,aAAM,cACN,aAAM,4LAEN,aAAM,cACN,aAAM,oKAEN,aAAM,cACN,aAAM,kHAEN,aAAM,cACN,aAAM,oJAEN,aAAM,cACN,aAAM,iJAEN,GACF,cACN,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,uBAC3B,sGAAuF,EACrF,cACN,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,uBAC3B,eAAQ,SAAS,CAAC,WAAW,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,2CAA2C,CAAC,eAAe,CAAC,EAAE,EAAU,EACxG,cACN,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,wBAC3B,oCAAqB,cACrB,gIAEI,aAAM,cACN,aAAM,6ZAEN,aAAM,cACN,aAAM,mvBACutB,GAC/tB,cACN,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,wBAC3B,+CAAgC,cAChC,6mBAQwF,GAEtF,GACH,CAGf,CAEA,cAAeA,gBAAe"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
