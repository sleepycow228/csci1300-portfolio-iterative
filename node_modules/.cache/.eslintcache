finally, we created a hi-fi prototype, which refined our wireframe into a more complete product. While designing this prototype, we received some feedback:\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    user dashboard page: affordances weren't super clear... edit project buttons were small. we changed this so that users just click on the thumbnail of a project to edit it.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    user dashboard page: used to have too much focus on the welcome message, and not enough on projects. We made the thumbnails area bigger to fix this\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    various pages: make sure there is always a back button that goes to the previous page in the flow\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    login page: make distinction between login and signup more clear. we moved the signup button outside of the orange box to fix this.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    analytics should not be on the same page where users edit their project—it became too cluttered. we separated those pages to fix this.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className='ProjectSection'>\n                <h2> Here's a video showing our hifi prototype's flow! try watching in fullscreen.</h2>\n            </div>\n            <div className='ProjectSection'>\n                <iframe className=\"hi-fi-vid\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehLDglcQaUY\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            </div>\n            <div className='ProjectSection'>\n                <h1>User Testing</h1>\n                <p>\n                    We then submitted our hifi prototype to usertesting.com so we could get some real feedback.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    Generally, all users struggled with the “edit two things about the project” task. After they clicked on the edit button, the options that were presented to “edit” did not map internally with our users signaling that this would function as an edit. They were able to figure it out, but commented on the lack of clarity and were not sure if they had properly completed the task.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    Overall, our test results were not in-line with our expectations. While most users were able to figure out the task, they all noted the difficulty of doing so. We were expecting the task to be straightforward. Based on the testing, we would add text below the login button in the top right hand corner of the first screen indicating “login”. We would also add functionality to our metrics dashboard that allows users to directly click on each subtitle for further exploration and edits. We would also change the “components” tab on the Video Player edit screen to better represent potential edits that can be made to the project. Unfortunately, our post test questions were not presented to our testers for reasons unknown to us.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div className='ProjectSection'>\n                <h1>Conclusions & Takeaways</h1>\n                <p>I learned so much from going through the iterative design process.\n                    Working with a group to create a variety of ideas then working together\n                    to implement this was a great experience. I also gained a lot from\n                    recieving critiques and criticially thinking which responses to\n                    accept and modify the product based on. Another thing I'll\n                    takeaway from this experience is how to write an introduction\n                    to a user testing site. I think we originally made the mistake\n                    of assuming users would have a lot of context when wlaking into\n                    our product. This was something I now will make sure to consider moving forward.</p>\n\n            </div>\n        </div >\n\n    )\n}\n\nexport default IterativeDesign","/Users/jadeyhagiwara/browncs/csci1300/csci1300-portfolio/src/Responsive.js",[],[],{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"65","line":2,"column":10,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"68","line":7,"column":10,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":7,"endColumn":13},{"ruleId":"69","severity":1,"message":"70","line":18,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":18,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"72","severity":1,"message":"73","line":18,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":18,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"69","severity":1,"message":"70","line":26,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":26,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"72","severity":1,"message":"73","line":26,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":26,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"69","severity":1,"message":"70","line":36,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":36,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"72","severity":1,"message":"73","line":36,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":36,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"69","severity":1,"message":"70","line":46,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":46,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"72","severity":1,"message":"73","line":46,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":46,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"69","severity":1,"message":"70","line":56,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":56,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"72","severity":1,"message":"73","line":56,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":56,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"74","severity":1,"message":"75","line":70,"column":19,"nodeType":"76","messageId":"77","endLine":70,"endColumn":21},{"ruleId":"78","severity":1,"message":"79","line":10,"column":17,"nodeType":"71","endLine":10,"endColumn":69},{"ruleId":"78","severity":1,"message":"79","line":16,"column":17,"nodeType":"71","endLine":16,"endColumn":62},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"65","line":3,"column":10,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":3,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"80","line":4,"column":10,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":4,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"81","line":4,"column":16,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":4,"endColumn":21},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"82","line":4,"column":23,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":4,"endColumn":29},{"ruleId":"69","severity":1,"message":"70","line":36,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":36,"endColumn":31},{"ruleId":"72","severity":1,"message":"73","line":36,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":36,"endColumn":31},{"ruleId":"78","severity":1,"message":"79","line":52,"column":21,"nodeType":"71","endLine":52,"endColumn":81},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":107,"column":17,"nodeType":"71","endLine":107,"endColumn":114},"no-unused-vars","'useState' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'Nav' is defined but never used.","jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content","Anchors must have content and the content must be accessible by a screen reader.","JSXOpeningElement","jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid","The href attribute is required for an anchor to be keyboard accessible.
